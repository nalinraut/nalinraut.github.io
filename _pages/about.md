I'm a Software Engineer specializing in Robotics, currently developing robot behaviors for mobile platforms at Symbotic. I hold a Master's degree in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Pune. My interests include vision-language models for robotics (VLM/VLA) and sim-to-real transfer techniques.
