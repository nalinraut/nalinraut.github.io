Welcome to my personal website! I am a Software Engineer (Robotics) by profession. The key focus of my work lies in Robotics Application Development, Robot State Estimation and Localization Algorithms, and 2D as well as 3D Computer Vision.

I completed my master's degree in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, MA, USA and my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Pune, India. During my professional experience, I have exhibited a combination of independent skills and individual contribution towards team effort.

Apart from work, I am an amateur photographer and I like to go out whenever possible to get those clicks. In addition to the above, I also enjoy cooking.
