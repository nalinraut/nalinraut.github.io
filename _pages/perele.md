**Let's Make a Difference - National Youth Conference**  
"Let's Make A Difference" is a national youth conference held every year at Asia Plateau, Panchgani, India which aims at strengthening moral and ethical values. I am a part of the LMAD family since 2011 and have actively participated in 6 national conferences.

- Coordinator at National Youth Conference, Asia Plateau, Panchgani, India, 2015
- Coordinator at Regional Youth Conference, Baramati, India, 2013

Having interacted with people around the world through this cause and understanding the problems they face has seamlessly increased my interpersonal intelligence and made me more self-aware than ever.
