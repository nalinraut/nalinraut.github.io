<p style="text-align: justify"> I am a Software Engineer (Robotics) by profession. The key focus of my work lies in Robotics Application Development, Robot State Estimation and Localization Algorithms, and 2D as well as 3D Computer Vision. To add more, I completed my master's degree in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, MA, USA and my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Pune, India. During my professional experience, I have exhibited a combination of independent skills and individual contribution towards team effort. 
Apart from work, I am an amateur photographer and I like to go out whenever possible to get those clicks. In addition to the above, I also enjoy cooking.
